			<h1>TOTAL YIQ LOVE !!</h1>
			<h2>Analog color television effects in Blender</h2>
			<time>December 2025</time>
			<p>
				After making the RETARD ZONE HALLOWEEN 2025 video, for which I used the
				fantastic software 
				<a href="https://github.com/ntsc-rs/ntsc-rs">ntsc-rs</a> to fake
				convincing VHS / CRT footage, I was left with the dissatisfaction of not
				having made those effects using the Blender compositor. Especially now
				that the Video editor in Blender supports compositor nodes !

				So I knew what I had to do : I decided I was gonna implement those
				effects in Blender for future use, so that I would not have to rely on
				external software.
			</p>
			<p>
				To properly emulate the unique artifacts of analog television I first
				had to learn how analog color television works. I looked into the north
				american standard NTSC specifically, but the european equivalent PAL
				should be similar enough.
				NTSC uses some very clever trick to maximally use its very limited
				bandwith to fit in color data while also being backwards compatible with
				black and white television. I won't discuss or emulate all of them as I
				do not fully understand it, but a few things are important to know !

			<p>
				CRT Television screens, like most modern displays, create color by
				mixing three primary colors: red, green, and blue. The NTSC signal
				however, does not use RGB. The space of colors is three dimensional so
				we need 3 channels to send full color data. Since this system has to be
				backward compatible the first channel corresponds to luma or Y (or
				Y'), which is the percieved brightness of a color.
				The next two channels convey color information. PAL uses YUV (or Y'UV),
				where Y' is the luma, U is proportional to B-Y', and V is
				proportional to R-Y'. This allows for simple recovery of the R, G and B
				channels for display on a TV screen.
				NTSC uses a similar space, YIQ, where I and Q are 33-degree-rotated
				versions of U and V. The 33 degree rotation makes the circuitry to
				recover R, G and B more complicated, and for that reason a lot of US
				consumer TV's incorrectly interpreted the signal as YUV instead
				of YIQ to save cost.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having luma and color information separately lets us also exploit a
				quirk of human vision to save bandwith. Our eyes are much more sensitive
				to changes in brightness compared to changes in color, so we can keep a
				high resolution on the luma channel and lower the resolution in the color
				channels without much noticeable loss in image quality.
				It is thanks to this principle that NTSC can cram color information in
				the very limited amount of bandwith available.
			</p>
			<p>
				Applying our subsequent video degradation effects on YUV or YIQ instead
				of RGB will lead to much more TV-like results:

			<p>
				So far i've added smear, signal noise, sharpening and color adjustments
				in the YUV / YIQ space as effects, which already get us most of the way
				there as far as achieving an analog TV look goes. I'd like to add some
				more effects and maybe some VHS emulation in the future.
			</p>

				Here's an example of all the effects i've made so far in action:
